# Bloxflip Crash Predictor

A machine learning tool for predicting the outcome of rounds in the game Bloxflip. This package uses a artificial neural network (ANN) to make predictions.

## Overview

The `bloxflip-crash` package provides a machine learning model for predicting the outcome of rounds in the game Bloxflip. It uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to analyze data from past rounds and make predictions about the next round.

## What is an artificial neural network?

An artificial neural network (ANN) is a type of machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. ANNs are composed of interconnected "neurons" that can process and transmit information. They are trained using large datasets and are able to learn patterns and make predictions based on the data they have seen. ANNs are widely used in a variety of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling.
